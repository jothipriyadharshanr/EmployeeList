# Employee List Application
# What does this app do?
This Android application displays the list of employees from an API endpoint using a networking library 'retrofit'. The list can be also sorted by age of the employee or completely cleared.
These employee data are stored in local SQLite DB. The sorting and clear actions are performed by direct SQLite DB queries.
